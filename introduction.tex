\chapter{Introduction}
Not long ago, it was thought that number theory and abstract algebra were the
domain of pure mathemeticians with no applications to the real world. Now, they
are major subects of interest with applications in cryptograhy, electronic
currency, coding theory, and wireless communication.

This text will not follow any linear format. It won't go from top to bottom
or inside to out. It will be a meandering journey just as math is supposed to
be. New concepts will be introduced without notice or explanation. Wherever
possible I will try to reference more expository material in future chapters 
but maybe I won't. If your confused about a certain topic then that's a good
start.

However, it won't all be hooey. When I make strong conjectures I will layout 
and explain the proof. Most of this will be familiar stuff, albeit in a new light, but there may be some new things thrown in.
