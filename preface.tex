\chapter{Preface}
During my first discrete math class I became interested in number theory. I was
interested because it seemed complex, but it was based on the same rules I had
learned in elementary school. The more I learned the more connections I 
saw. I started thinking "Why wasn't this explained earlier?". Later, I took some
linear algebra, calculus, abstract algebra and read as much as I could in
between my normal computer science classes. The more I learned about these
abstract theories the more I saw how they all connected and could be useful
(to the bane of my pure math friends). I still think much of this material could
be used as a mathematical motivator in elementary level classes.

I am writing this book to solidify my learning, to give it shape. I am a 
computer scientist, software engineer, not a mathematician, but my interests
always bring me back to number theory. I will explain some important concepts
related to number theory and abstract algebra and I will show how to apply
these concepts using the language I'm familiar with, code.

All of the code in this book is written in go. I made a choice. I think it's a
good one. Helpful references for running the code examples can be found in
Appendix A. All of the source code is in a git repo somwhere that will be made
available at some time.
